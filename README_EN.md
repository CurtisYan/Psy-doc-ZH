# Psy Documentation Chinese Translation

> Chinese translation project for Psy official documentation

[中文版](README.md) | **English**

## 📖 Project Overview

This project provides Chinese translations for the [official Psy documentation](https://psy.xyz/docs). Since the official website currently doesn't offer a Chinese version, this translation project was created to help Chinese-speaking users better understand and learn about Psy blockchain technology.

Psy is an innovative blockchain platform featuring unique mining mechanisms, smart contract systems, and user tree aggregation technology. Through this translation project, Chinese users can better understand Psy's technical architecture and working principles.
